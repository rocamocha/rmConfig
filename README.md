# rmConfig
rmConfig is a tool for creating and modifying configuration files for the Reactive Music mod for Fabric Minecraft.

## Features
- Add songs to events from a master list imported from your songpack's music folder 🎵
- Define events with just a few clicks ⭐
- Disable / Enable entire events with ease 💃
- Support for user defined event strings & biome lists 🌴
- GUI based songpack creation from start to finish 🕹️

⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️
---
If you have Unicode characters in your music folder's filenames, for song previewing to work -> you must enable the Windows Beta option for enhanced UTF-8 support, found in Control Panel > Region > Administrative > Change system locale...

rmConfig was developed because I love music, and the ability to customize when and where different music plays in Minecraft is [CircuitLord](https://github.com/CircuitLord)'s gift to us all!
